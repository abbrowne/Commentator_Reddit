'this season needed more of lyanna mormont you remember after s7e2 when she had a total of 5 sentences and everybody complained about the fanservice'

'cousins with lord jeor in the night s watch and jorah in disgrace she was the nearest ranking mormont'

'yeah she was in the season 7 opener'

'if he is back in the fold he would be lord mormont and she would just be little lyanna'

'just for a little perspective there are fucking zombies and dragons in this show it wasn t meant to portray reality there s nothing saying that lyanna mormont couldn t get good at operating a crossbow in the next season i don t expect her to be slinging around a claymore but she inspires her people and she has shown to be brave so why not'

'well it was not like lyanna needed it right at that time when jon offered it to jorah they were north of the wall and looking for wights'

'but jorah was also the heir to house mormont at that point presumably the head of the house gets the sword'
